## Requirements
There are two missing values that must be added to your string resources file.

```
    <string name="google_api_key">Key-Goes-Here</string>
    <string name="search_instance_identifier">ID-Goes-Here</string>
```
The first value is the API key generated by registering for the [Google Programmable Search Engine API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction), and the second is the identifier (they call it `cx`) of your custom search instance. In this case, target it to https://xkcd.com.

Plug those in and you should be good to go with a normal build.
